/*
A car salesperson typically earns an hourly wage and a commission on any sales they completed. They typically work 30 to 40
hours a week, earning $5.25 to $7.50 an hour. Additionally, they earn 1% to 3% of all sales they've completed that week,
which a typical car sells for $10,000 to $30,000. A salesperson with a 1% commission that sells a car for $20,000 earns $200.00.

Write a program which prompts the user to enter the hourly rate, hours worked, the sales commission percent and the total
sales of a salesperson and calculates their total earnings. The program should include multiple methods. (What ARE the
smaller pieces?)

Example:

Hourly Rate: 6.25
Hours Worked: 33.5
Sales Commission: 1.5%
Total Sales: $65,000.00

Total Earnings: $1184.38
